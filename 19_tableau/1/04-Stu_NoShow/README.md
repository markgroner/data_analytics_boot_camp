Instructions:
 * Create a line chart that compares the ages of patients against the total number of appointments.  Then split this graph based upon gender and whether the patient showed up to their appointment.

 * Create a pair of bar charts that compare how many patients showed up to appointments verses how many were no-shows in different neighborhoods.

 * Create a stacked bar chart that compares no-shows to those who made it to appointment based upon the day of the week.

 * Create a pair of line graphs that compare age versus diabetes in both men and women.

 * Create a pair of line graphs that compare age versus alcoholism in both men and women.

Bonus:
 * Figure out how to create filters and manually exclude non-significant values from your charts using the `Filters` panel.

 * Now, using filters, modify your charts so that they are more visually understandable.
