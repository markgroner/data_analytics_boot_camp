* **Instructions:**

  * Using a `while` loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", and then print out a chain of ascending numbers from 0 to the number input.

  * After the results have printed, ask the user if they would like to continue. If "y" is entered, keep the chain running by inputting a new number and starting a new count from 0 to the number input. If "n" is entered, exit the application.

* **Bonus:**

  * Rather than just displaying numbers starting at 0, have the numbers start at the end of the previous chain.
