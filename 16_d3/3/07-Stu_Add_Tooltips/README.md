# Add Tooltips with the d3-tip library

In this activity we will add tooltips to the line chart using the d3-tip library.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder, start the python server, and open the chart in the web browser.

* Take a moment to study the chart in the browser and move on to the [app.js](Unsolved/app.js) file.

* Begin adding additional logic to render a tooltip for each data-point containing the number of pizzas eaten during the specified month.

* The unsolved version of this activity already has a cdn for d3-tip included inside of the [index.html](Unsolved/index.hmtl) file. 

## Hints

* Refer to the [d3-tip documentation](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip) for for examples of creating tool-tips with d3-tip.
