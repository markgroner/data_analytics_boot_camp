// A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
// Imagine you have a screen that is 1000 pixels tall
// You want to display your test scores, which range from zero to one hundred, visually

// Question 1: how many pixels tall would a score of 100 be on the screen?

// Question 2: how many pixels tall would a score of 0 be on the screen?

// Question 3: how many pixels tall would a score of 50 be on the screen?

// Question 4: 75?
