//ANOTHER THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
// Now imagine that you want to create a bar chart of the first four presidents (and perhaps their age)
// Your screen is 1000 pixels wide, and you want to spread out the bars representing each president evenly across it
// d3.scaleBand() allows automatic positioning of NON-NUMERICAL data, such as strings
// .domain() specifies the array of string data
// .range() specifies the extent of the screen real estate, in this case from zero to 1000 pixels in width


var presidents = ["Washington", "Adams", "Jefferson", "Madison"];
var myOtherScale = d3.scaleBand().domain(presidents).range([0,1000]);
