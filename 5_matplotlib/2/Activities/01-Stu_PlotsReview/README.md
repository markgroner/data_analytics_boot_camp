## Instructions

* What kinds of plots matches the datasets below?

```
# DATASET 1
gyms = ["Crunch", "Planet Fitness", "NY Sports Club", "Rickie's Gym"]
members = [49, 92, 84, 53]

# DATASET 2
x_lim = 2 * np.pi
x_axis = np.arange(0, x_lim, 0.1)
sin = np.sin(x_axis)

# DATASET 3
planet_fitness_ages = ["18-25", "26-33", "34-41", "42+"]
members = [31, 27, 18, 16]
x_axis = np.arange(0, len(planet_fitness_ages))
colors = ["yellowgreen", "red", "lightcoral", "lightskyblue"]
explode = (0.05, 0, 0, 0)

# DATASET 4
sq_ft = [929, 1000, 693, 1320, 821, 925, 750]
house_price = [285000, 300000, 250000, 315000, 275000, 280000, 260000]
```

* Create a plot for each of the datasets above, making certain to provide each chart with a title and labels
