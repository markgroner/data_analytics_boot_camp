Sleep in Mammals

Description

Includes brain and body weight, life span, gestation time, time sleeping, and predation and danger indices for 62 species of mammals. Of interest is to predict the time spent sleeping and the proportion of sleep time in dream sleep.

Variable		Description
BodyWt		body weight (kg)
BrainWt		brain weight (g)
NonDreaming		slow wave ("nondreaming") sleep (hrs/day)
Dreaming		paradoxical ("dreaming") sleep (hrs/day)
TotalSleep		total sleep, sum of slow wave and paradoxical sleep (hrs/day)
LifeSpan		maximum life span (years)
Gestation		gestation time (days)
Predation		predation index (1-5)
1 = minimum (least likely to be preyed upon); 5 = maximum (most likely to be preyed upon)
Exposure		sleep exposure index (1-5)
1 = least exposed (e.g. animal sleeps in a well-protected den); 5 = most exposed
Danger		overall danger index (1-5) (based on the above two indices and other information)
1 = least danger (from other animals); 5 = most danger (from other animals)
