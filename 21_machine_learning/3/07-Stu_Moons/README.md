# Student Deep Learning Challenge

In this activity, you will solve two seperate challenges using both a regular Neural Network and a Deep Neural Network.

## Instructions

### Challenge 1 - Moons Dataset

* Create a Neural Network and Deep Neural Network Classifier that correctly classifies both moons from the dataset.

* Train both models using 100 trainig epochs.

* Compare the accuracy of both models

### Notes

* Try to find the minimal architecture (number of nodes) and minimum training iterations required to achieve a score of at least .90.
