# Media Queries

* In this activity, we will add media queries to make a web page more responsive at smaller screen sizes.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved Folder](Unsolved) and add media queries to decrease the size of the `li` tags inside the `navbar` so they fit when we shrink the screen size. We can probably do this by reducing each `li` element's `padding` (within `styles.css`).

* Also reduce the `padding` along each side of the `article` with a class of `post`.

## Bonus

* Try making the `li` elements inside the `navbar` disappear entirely in place of a drop-down menu with all of the same options.

## Hints

* A reference for media query syntax can be found at [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)

* You can create a drop-down menu using the `select` and `option` elements. See [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) for `select` elements.

* You can show and hide elements on a web page with the visibility property. See [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility)
