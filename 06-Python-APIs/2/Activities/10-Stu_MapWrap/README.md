# OpenWeather API Wrapper

This activity demonstrates the additional ease of use afforded by API wrappers.

## Instructions

* Install the openweathermapy API wrapper.

* Create a settings object with your API key and preferred units of measurement.

* Get data for each city in `cities.csv`.

* Create a list to get the temperature, latitude, and longitude in each city

* Create a Pandas DataFrame with the results.

* Print your summaries to verify that everything went smoothly.

## Bonus

* If you finish early, read about, and experiment with, the `*` syntax.

* Pass a `columns` keyword argument to `pd.DataFrame`, and provide labels for the temperature and coordinate data.
